########## Next Steps ########

- make the training pipeline different
    * optimizer and model compilation not inside model function

- take the functions used in test_base_model out and create separate modules

- get bug fixes for the training based on:

- find your music tracks (perhaps Chopin's)

- make model smaller and reduce training time if possible
    * if you can't migrate code to collabe, keeping the same format if possible
    * check prices for collab resources
